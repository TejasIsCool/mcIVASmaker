# TODO
# Vertical/Horizontal orientation of the schematic
# Perhaps commands in one area, frames in another
# A set amount of frame peed, 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1
# For a frame speed, the user decides if the video is slowed to show all frames
# Or frame are skipped to match relative speed
# Commands or no commands(Obviously, no redstone mechanism, orrrrr maybeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
# Nah too hard (Maybe black and white(as lamps), and as rom instead?)
